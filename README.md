Age comparison App 

 

The Main purpose and inspiration behind the development was to help a friend named Sarah who envisioned an android app that compares users ages the historical ages. We have made this possible the creation of the Historic app that allow users to be able to take a trip back in time and give them a chance to learn about the past and the history behind their age. This was made possible by creating an app that compares users age to a historical figure and then enlightening them about the historical figure's proud history. For example, when the user types in the age “38” the program compares and tries to find a historical figure, if no historical figure was found the user will be met with an error message, if a historical figure was found the app will show a message comparing the ages and display the historical figure and what he/she was most known for. Seeing that the UI (User interface) is so basic it can be used as a fun tool for students while still serving an educational purpose. 

Historical figures include: 

Martin Luther king Jr who died at the age of 39. Who was an American activist. He played a pivotal role during 1955.

There are multiple reasons behind why the UI (User interface) is simplistic rather than complicated, these reasons include: 

- Ease of Use: In general, consumers can comprehend and use a basic user interface more easily. It lessens cognitive burden and improves users' ability to do things naturally and without feeling overwhelmed.  

 

-Accessibility: Older persons or people with disabilities may find it difficult to use complex interfaces. A more approachable interface with uncomplicated navigation and user-friendly interactions enhances accessibility and guarantees that a broader spectrum of users may efficiently utilise the programme. 

- Faster Learning Curve: Less training or documentation is required when using an easy-to-use interface, as users can pick it up quickly. This is particularly crucial for applications that are rarely used or that aim to reach a large audience.  

 

Decreased Errors: User errors are more likely to occur in complex interfaces, which can cause annoyance and lower productivity. Error-prone user interfaces can be minimised by keeping things simple and removing superfluous elements. 

 

Faster Performance: When it comes to devices with limited resources or slower internet connections, simple interfaces frequently translate into faster loading times and better performance. This lowers frustration and enhances the user experience overall.  

Reduced Development and Maintenance Costs: The design, development, and maintenance of complex interfaces take more time and money. You may reduce development expenses and assure easier maintenance and updates in the future by maintaining a basic interface.  

 

Concentrate on Core Functionality: You may ensure that your application satisfies user demands without extraneous features or distractions by concentrating on its core functionality with a basic interface. This may lead to a user experience that is more efficient and productive. 

Increased User pleasure: In the end, more user pleasure results from a straightforward user interface. Applications that are simple to use, intuitive, and effective are valued by users, and as a result, adoption and loyalty grow over time.  

More user pleasure, usability, and accessibility result from simpler user interface designs, which eventually help your programme succeed. 

GitHub is well-known tool used by Developers. GitHub can be used by developers to save their work online Aswell as track changes to see what works best when it comes to your project. GitHub also allows for projects to be collaborative. In our case GitHub will be used to upload our projects so that they can be assessed. 

Ways to utilize GitHub and GitHub actions include: 

-Hosting repositories: GitHub allows you to host repositories on the cloud. Which makes it possible for teams to collaborate on code, manage issues and pull requests. 

-Version Control with Git: Git allows multiple Developers to work on the same project simultaneously. 

-Custom actions: Other than using per-built actions, you can also create custom actions to automate tasks specific to your workflow. 

In conclusion, GitHub and GitHub actions are known as powerful tools that can be used for hosting, collaboration, and automating workflows for software development programs. By putting these tools to effective use, teams can increase productivity, maintain code quality, and accelerate the delivery of software programs.
